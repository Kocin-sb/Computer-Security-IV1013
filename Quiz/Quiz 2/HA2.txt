3 IPsec standards define two modes of use, which are these IPsec modes?

4 which of following statements are true about security associations? 
- SA can be manually configured

5 IP Spoofing 
- the attacker sends an IP packet with fake source address 
 
6 which of following pieces must you supply when creating a policy that configures IPsec to use tunnelmode between two routers over the internet?

-block outgoing packets from the internal network with source addresses from outside the internal network 
 
10 Which of the following statements about the capabilities and configuration of firewalls are true?
