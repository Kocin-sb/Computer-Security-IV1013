# Computer-Security-IV1013

## Course contents

Basic cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
Cryptographic hashing and digital signatures.
Security in protocols and services of the Internet.
Certificates and infrastructures for open key encryption.
Security in network systems: routers, firewalls, and systems to detect intrusion.
Security in operating systems.
Software security: vulnerability, attacks, and defence mechanisms.

## Intended learning outcomes

The course gives an introduction to the basics of cryptography, security in computer systems, and network security. On completion of the course the student should be able to:

explain basic mechanisms in, and the structure of, secure communications protocols
describe weaknesses in computer systems, software, networks, and communications protocols as well as explain attacks that utilise such weaknesses
explain and compare advantages and disadvantages with common cryptographic technologies
design and implement simple cryptographic applications
account for and recognise threats against information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. as well as choose appropriate methods to protect against threats
design, implement, and evaluate security in networks.
